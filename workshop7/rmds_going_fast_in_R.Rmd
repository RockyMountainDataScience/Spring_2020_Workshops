```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## What do?

- Parallelization

  - Principles
  
  - Implementation (using `doParallel`)
  
- Alternative Languages in R

  - C++ using `Rcpp`
  
  - Julia using `JuliaCall`

- Measuring Improvement

## Why for?

- Speed

- Access to language specific libraries outside of R

- Foundations for GPU Computing

## Principles of Parallelization

![A Visual Example of Parallel Processing](/home/jordanlove/Downloads/parallelization_graphic.jpg)

Tasks of the type shown in this example are often called "Embarassingly Parallel"

## Common Applications of Parallel Computing

- Image Problems (Neural Networks, Image Manipulation)

- Parallel Algorithms 

- Large Datasets (Distributed Computing)

- Almost any problem that needs to go fast(er) and has many repetitive subtasks

## Great, how does it work?

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
simulate_covid19 <- function(county){
  ...
}

for(county in county_list){
  simulate_covid19(county)
}
```

## Great, how does it work?

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(doParallel)
library(foreach)

simulate_covid19 <- function(county){
  ...
}

num_cores <- detectCores()
cl <- makeCluster(num_cores)

foreach(county in county_list) %do% {
  simulate_covid19(county)
}

stopCluster(cl)
```

## Short Tutorial: Parallelization

Let's show it in action.

## Parallelization for Python Users

- The library `multiprocessing` provides basic parallel processing abilities

- Not as easy-to-use due to Python being a more general purpose language

- Good examples & introduction found at `https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/multiprocessing.html`

## Using Rcpp 

- C++ is an iteration (literally) on the C language

- Known for being extremely fast, C and C++ are typically used as benchmarks for many other languages

- Not as forgiving or as transparent as other languages...

## Basics about C++

- Statically Typed Language

- Compiled Language

- Rcpp makes it easier for R and R Studio Users

## Rcpp Workflow

- Replace only the necessary functions using C++ through Rcpp

- Export those compiled C++ functions to your R environment

- Use them just like you would an R function

## Short Tutorial: Rcpp

Let's show it in action.

## C/C++ for Python Users

- `Cython` is a Python package which allows C/C++ usage

- Same goal as Rcpp

- More details found at `https://cython.org/`

## Another Language: Julia

- Julia is a relatively new language

- Focused on scientific applications, it focuses on being faster than C in some cases

- Far more forgiving and intuitive syntax

## Using Julia in R

- The R Ecosystem does not have well vetted packages for using Julia yet...

- We will focus on using one of the best packages currently available: `JuliaCall`

- While the typical file ending for Julia files is `.jl`, using a `.julia` file ending in R Studio will enable syntax highlighting

## Julia in R Workflow

- The workflow is similar to Rcpp, but slightly more manual

- Entire Julia scripts can be called from R, but it is recommend to source functions from Julia into R

## Short Tutorial: JuliaCall

Let's try it out!

## Julia for Python Users

- No immediately accessible libraries for cross-langauge usage

- `IJulia` package in the Julia ecosystem allows for Julia to be used in a Jupyter notebook

- More information can be found here: `https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl`

## Concluding Thoughts

- Combining Rcpp and parallelization is certainly an option!

- Combining Julia and parallelization... may be an option.

- Depending on if your task can be easily parallelized or not determines which technique used to speed up execution time
